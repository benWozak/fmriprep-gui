          TE-dependent analysis (tedana)is a Python library for denoising
          multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. tedana
          originally came about as a part of the ME-ICA pipeline, although it
          has since diverged. An important distinction is that while the ME-ICA
          pipeline originally performed both pre-processing and TE-dependent
          analysis of multi-echo fMRI data, tedana now assumes that youâ€™re
          working with data which has been previously preprocessed.
